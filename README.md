# Word-Guess-Game

The theme of this game is Metal bands so throw your devil horns up and get guessing.
Press any key to start the game.
Press the key you wish to guess, if you're correct the letter will appear but if you're wrong your remaining guesses will decrease.
If you guess the word within the alotted guesses a sound will play and you'll move on to the next word.
If you fail to guess the word you will move to the next word and watch as your losses rack up.
The same word will never be displayed twice in a row.
All keys are in play so be careful to not mistype your guesses.
