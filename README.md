# Word-Guess-Game

The theme of this game is Metal bands so throw your devil horns up and get guessing. <br />
Press any key to start the game. <br />
Press the key you wish to guess, if you're correct the letter will appear but if you're wrong your remaining guesses will decrease. <br />
If you guess the word within the alotted guesses a sound will play and you'll move on to the next word. <br /> 
If you fail to guess the word you will move to the next word and watch as your losses rack up. <br />
The same word will never be displayed twice in a row. <br />
All keys are in play so be careful to not mistype your guesses.
